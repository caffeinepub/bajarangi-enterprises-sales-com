- Build backend CRUD operations for products and business info management
- Create public-facing pages: Home (hero section), Products (grid layout), Product Details, About Us, and Contact
- Build admin dashboard with product management (add/edit/delete) and business info editor
- Implement click-to-call functionality using business phone number
- Apply responsive green agriculture-themed design across all pages
